# **CLIENT**APPLICATIONs

(Detailled Information will be added here after we have published the stable version.)

## DRIVE

The PhilleConnect Drive application has the main purpose to handle the authentication and mount the samba shares to the system.

When installed with the Installer the RunOnceCreator, as well as the VNC-Server and a watchdog will be installed on the system.

## TEACHER

The PhilleConnect Teacher application includes the functions of the PhilleConnect Drive application and extends it with Screes for monitoring and controlling student PCs in a PC room.

The RunOnceCreator will be installed by the installer as well.

## START

The Login-screen that is shown when you boot up your OS.

## RunOneCreator

Windows-specific: The RunOnceCreator takes care that the Login-Application will be started every time Windows boots up.

## Systemclient

This controls the Access to student PCs.

## ClientRegistrationTool

This makes it easy to add new Client PCs to the Server.
