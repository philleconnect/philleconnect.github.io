# **TEACHER**APPLICATION

The sdmin-frontent is available by accessing the network address of the docker-host it runs on on port 84 for unencrypted acces or on port 447 for encrypted access with a self signed certificate (has to be accepted in the browser on first access).

This software is the central controlling point for configuring the PhilleConnect network.

It keeps information about the PC's in the network in a sql-database and has an interface for managing user data in the LDAP-Container as well.

Detailled Information will be added here after we have published the stable version.
