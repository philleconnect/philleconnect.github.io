# Website of PhilleConnect.org

This is the Website whick is created by the GitHub Jekyll Engine.

Edit the files in `pages` and add more pages if necessary.

Just make sure that the FrontMatter is right:

```
---
layout: page
title: <insert your title, begin with a capital Letter!>
permalink: <insert the link the page should be available at: Only site title, not path, with capital Letter starting!>
tags: <'main' to enter it to the Main Menu, a site title to add it as submenu-entry to the site>
lang: de
---
```

If you want to test it before submit install jekyll (`sudo apt install jekyll`) and run `jekyll serve` in the root folder.

The site is then available under [http://localhost:4000]
