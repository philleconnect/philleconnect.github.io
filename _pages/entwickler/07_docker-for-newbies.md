# **DOCKER**NEWBIE

You have heared about the buzz-word "docker" but have never used it?

No Problem, although there are plenty of "Getting Started with Docker"-Tutorials out there here is a really quick summary/command reference of the most important things for the work with PhilleConnect.

### `docker-compose up --build -d`
This will bring up all the containers configured in the `docker-compose.yml` in the working directory.

With the option `--build` you can force a rebuild of the images even if there already are images found on the system.

The optin `-d` will start them in the detached-mode (in the background).

...more to come here soon!
